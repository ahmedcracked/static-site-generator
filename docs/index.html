        <article><div><h1>Hi!</h1><p>I'm Ahmed Esmail, this page represents my latest Python coding project: the "static site generator" is a program where you can write your static site/blog in Markdown instead of HTML.</p><p>The program converts the content written in Markdown to HTML files at the end so that it can serve as a functional webpage.</p><p>It's useful because Markdown format is much easier to write. However, HTML is more verbose and developer-oriented. Markdown is more user-friendly and used across many different apps like Discord & WhatsApp.</p><p>It can be installed and used locally on your computer. I'll work on providing the installation method later, as the project needs additional tiny modifications.</p><h2>Demo</h2><p>You can see a bigger webpage that has different blogs generated using the project <a href="/static-site-generator/demo">right here</a>.</p><h2>Technologies Used</h2><ul><li>Python</li><li>HTML & CSS</li><li>Git & GitHub</li></ul><p>Want to get in touch? <a href="/static-site-generator/contact">Contact me here</a>.</p></div></article>
