# Hi!

I'm Ahmed, this page represents my latest coding project, the **static site generator** is a software that enables you to write your own static sites/blogs in Markdown instead of HTML.
Markdown is far more superior for normal people (not developers), You might be familiar with Markdown as it's used in a lot of places, but you might not know HTML yet.

## Demo

You can see a bigger site that has different blogs & posts that is generated with the generator [right here](/demo)

## Technologies used in the project

- Python
- CSS & HTML
- Git & GitHub
