# Hi!

I'm Ahmed Esmail, this page represents my latest Python coding project: a "static site generator" is a program where you can write your static site/blog in Markdown instead of HTML.

The program converts the content written in Markdown to HTML files at the end so that it can serve as a functional webpage.

It's useful because Markdown format is much easier to write. However, HTML is more verbose and developer-oriented. Markdown is more user-friendly and used across many different apps like Discord & WhatsApp.

It can be installed and used locally on your computer. I'll work on providing the installation method later, as the project needs additional tiny modifications.

## Demo

You can see a bigger webpage that has different blogs generated using the project [right here](/demo).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- HTML & CSS
- Git & GitHub
